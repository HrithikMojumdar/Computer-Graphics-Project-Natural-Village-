# Computer-Graphics-Project-Natural-Village-
Computer Graphics Project (Natural Village).  We implemented a project for our computer graphics final project. Our project name is Natural Village Project. In the project, we use different kinds of Shapes. Like- circle shapes for sun, moon, tree, and cloud. Triangle shape for paddy, small tree, plow, hill, stars. Rectangular shape for sky and river and field. polygon shape for man. Line shapes for waves. These shapes are easy to identify.  We also use RGB colors in the projects so that we can clearly define the view of the village. In this project, we add day and night moods. So that we can feel both environments of the village. We know that we can design games with computer graphics and we also can animate them. So we add animation to our project.
